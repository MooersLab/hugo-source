This is my first attempt at using Hugo to develop a blog post. I've been using a different template that is quite complex and hard to remember. What I like about this approach is that I can generate the text inside of Emacs in an org file and then the changes that are made are automatically shipped out to the web page in HTML. This means that I can build out using the whisperer software to carry out dictations that make up at least the first draft of a blog post.
