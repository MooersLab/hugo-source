This is my first attempt at using Hugo to develop a blog post. 
I have set up a GitHub workflow that copies the updated files from the hugo-source repo to the mooerslab.github.io repo.
I have to push the updated files to the hugo-source.

I have been using a different template that is quite complex and hard to remember. 
It would take me 30-60 minutes to recall how to make an update once every several months.
